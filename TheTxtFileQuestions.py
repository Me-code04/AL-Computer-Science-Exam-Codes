'''A procedure LastLines() will:
• take the name of a text file as a parameter
• output the last three lines from that file, in the same order as they appear in the file.
 Note:
• Use local variables LineX, LineY and LineZ to store the three lines from the file.
• You may assume the file exists and contains at least three lines.
 Write Python code for the procedure LastLines().'''

f = open(TheTxtFile.txt, "r")

print(len(f))
